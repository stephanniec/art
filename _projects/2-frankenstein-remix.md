### Story Background
Years after genius chef Viktor Frankenstein is awarded his second Michelin star, he finds himself crumbling under the immense pressure to create increasingly inventive dishes. When he is finally forced to declare bankruptcy, he closes shop and travels home to the Bavarian countryside for the first time in 25 years. Ashamed of his failure, Viktor leads a secluded life punctured only by the occasional visit to the town square for groceries. This is where he meets Hugo, the timid son of a local butcher whose love and talent for baking reminds Viktor of why he started cooking in the first place. And so begins an unlikely friendship as Hugo helps Viktor heal old wounds, and Viktor helps Hugo navigate the culinary industry.

### Additional Notes
* When the Hugo (the monster) is cooking, he is comfortable. The way he holds himself changes. He stands up straighter and doesn't mind exposing his face (ties back his bangs).
