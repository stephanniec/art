### Story Background
Years after genius chef Viktor Frankenstein is awarded his second Michelin star, he finds himself crumbling under the immense pressure to create increasingly inventive dishes. When he is finally forced to declare bankruptcy, he decides to travel home for the first time in 25 years. Tired and ashamed, Viktor retreats to his family's country estate, only venturing into town once a week to grab groceries at the farmer's market. This is where he meets Hugo, the timid son of the local butcher whose love and talent for baking reminds Viktor of why he started cooking in the first place.

### Additional Notes
* When the Hugo (the monster) is cooking, he is comfortable. The way he holds himself changes. He stands up straighter and doesn't mind exposing his face (ties back his bangs).
