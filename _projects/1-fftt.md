## Setting Overview
* Two years after a 37-year-long multinational war
* Humans are no longer at the top of the food chain
* Large swatches of greenery teeming with vicious predators and noxious plants now separate one pocket of humanity from the next
* To survive, vestigial and fledgling nations are constantly clashing over resources and military leverage
* Every settlement (big or small) is its own sovereign entity
* It no longer matters if a person is young, old, rich, or poor and etc. Here, only the strong survive.     

## Exploration - The Farm Sanctuary

<center>Delphinium "Del" Elatum (4)</center><br>
Del is the youngest resident of The Farm. He is named after the vibrant flower species; his name was randomly picked out of an old plant guide when the owner of the refuge ran out of monikers of all the nameless kids passing through. He likes the smell of pine and hoards dried sprigs in a small cloth bag. He also has a tendency to bite people.

## Exploration - Fugitives
<!-- Satellite Duo -->
<center>Luca (13)</center><br>
Luca is a former child soldier who is on the run from human traffickers and military programs seeking to pad their pockets and dwindling troops respectively. He is a transfemoral amputee. Although he has never been deployed to the front officially, he has seen his fair share of bloodshed: he was the top ranked trainee in an elite program where students were encouraged to fight to the death, and often attached to special operations teams upon graduation. As a result, his moral compass is very skewed.
