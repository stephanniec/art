## Setting Overview
* Two years after a 37-year-long multinational war
* Large swatches of greenery teeming with vicious predators and noxious plants now separate one pocket of humanity from the next
* To survive, vestigial and fledgling nations are constantly clashing over resources and military leverage
* Every settlement (big or small) is its own sovereign entity
* It no longer matters if a person is young, old, rich, or poor and etc. Here, only the strong survive.     

## Exploration - The Farm Sanctuary
<!-- Insert gen exploration of farm permanent residents -->

### Delphinium "Del" Elatum (4)

Del is the youngest (but not the newest) resident of The Farm. He is named after the vibrant flower species; his name was randomly picked out of an old plant guide when the owner of the refuge ran out of monikers for all the nameless kids passing through.

## Exploration - Wandering Fugitives

### Luca (13)

Luca is an ex-child soldier who is wanted by human traffickers and military programs seeking to pad their pockets and dwindling troops respectively. Although he has never been deployed to the front officially, he has seen his fair share of bloodshed: he used to be the top ranked trainee at a notable mercenary camp where students were encouraged to fight to the death, and often attached to special operations teams upon graduation. While he is tired of violence, years of growing up in a controlled, ruthless environment has greatly skewed his moral compass.
