<h2 id="car">Project Self-Driving Robot</h2>
`Date: June 2 - 10, 2017` <br>
`Tools used: Onshape, Laser cutter, 3D printer`

<center>CAD models of custom parts built for a car prototype</center>

Hardware for a line following robot was created for the 2017 Tech Cup at Northwestern. A housing unit was fabricated out of laser cut acrylic to protect circuitry. Brackets were 3D printed out of PLA to fix motors to the car chassis. Wheels were 3D printed out of PLA to carry the vehicle around a gray racetrack.

In the final prototype, 2" wheels were used instead of the 4" ones to help the car generate more torque at lower motor velocities.

`Date: October 15 - 24, 2017` <br>
`Tools used: SolidWorks, NX, Bandsaw, CNC Mill`

<h2 id="box">Project Tribute</h2>
`Date: November 26 - 29, 2017` <br>
`Tools used: SolidWorks, Inkscape, Laser cutter`

<center>CAD model of an acrylic display case for Project Daydream</center>

The display case is a 10” x 10” x 4” acrylic box with a cosmetic lid. It consists of 18 pieces that snugly slot together like a jigsaw puzzle. Scaffolding inside the box supports the weight of the an aluminum centerpiece along 5 of its 6 faces. Balsa wood was used to verify if the smallest features could be cut. Acrylic with a thickness of 0.25” was used for the final product.
